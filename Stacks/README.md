# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used in scenarios where you need to keep track of function calls, undo operations, or manage resources in a controlled manner.

## Implementation
- [Typescript](./ts)
- [Java](./java) (soon)
- [Go](./go) (soon)

## Usage
Stacks can be used in various applications, such as:
- Implementing function call management (call stack)
- Implementing undo/redo functionality in applications
- Parsing expressions (e.g., in compilers)
- Managing resources in a controlled manner (e.g., memory management)
