# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structur where elements, called nodes, are not stored contiguously in memory. Instead, each node contains data and a reference, or link, to the next node in the sequence.

In a linked list the first element is called the `Head` and the last element is called the `Tail`.

## Implementation
- [Typescript](./ts)
- [Java](./java) (soon)
- [Go](./go) (soon)

## Usage
Linked lists can be used in various applications, such as:
- Implementing stacks and queues
- Implementing hash tables with separate chaining
- Implementing adjacency lists for graphs
- Implementing undo/redo functionality in applications
