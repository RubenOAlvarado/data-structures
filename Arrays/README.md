# Arrays

Arrays are a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming.
They can be used to store a collection of data, such as a list of numbers, strings, or objects. Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating large amounts of data efficiently.

## Custom Array Implementation
I implemented a custom array class in TypeScript, Java, and Go. The custom array class includes methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements in the array. The implementation is designed to be simple and easy to understand, while also being efficient and flexible:
- [TypeScript Implementation](./custom-array/ts)
- [Java Implementation](./custom_array/java)
- [Go Implementation](./custom_array/go)
